# claude-memory-framework Conventions

## Guiding Principle

> Claude must be able to orient itself in ≤30 seconds: read CLAUDE.md (index), identify what it needs, and navigate to the correct file without loading unnecessary context.

---

## Layered Memory Architecture

### Layer 1: Root CLAUDE.md (index)
- Recommended maximum ~70 lines. Only contains: system overview, navigation table, persistence rules.
- Does **NOT** contain: credentials, builds, changelogs, project status, lessons learned.
- Never duplicate information that exists in other files — only point to them with paths.

### Layer 2: claude-memory/ (reference documents)
- Specialized files: ARCHITECTURE.md, CREDENTIALS.md, BUILD_COMMANDS.md, etc.
- Each file has a single purpose. If a piece of data fits in more than one file, it goes in the most specific one.
- `projects/` contains the working memory for active projects.

### Layer 3: CLAUDE.md in src/ (module context)
- Describe the code **as it IS**: what the module does, what patterns it follows, known pitfalls.
- Do **NOT** contain: project status, changelogs, pending tasks.
- They are stable — they only change when the code they accompany changes.

### Separation Rule

| Type of information                          | Where it goes                                              |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| What this module does, patterns, pitfalls    | `CLAUDE.md` inside `src/{module}/`                         |
| Prior analysis, mappings, constraints        | `claude-memory/projects/{name}/TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md`        |
| Phase plan, files, order                     | `claude-memory/projects/{name}/PLAN.md`                    |
| Deliverable technical documentation          | `claude-memory/projects/{name}/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md`         |
| Project status, next step                    | `claude-memory/projects/{name}/CURRENT_STATUS.md`          |
| Project change history                       | `claude-memory/projects/{name}/CHANGELOG.md`               |
| Reusable technical lessons                   | `claude-memory/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`                         |
| Credentials and endpoints                    | `claude-memory/CREDENTIALS.md`                             |
| Build commands                               | `claude-memory/BUILD_COMMANDS.md`                          |
| Global system architecture                   | `claude-memory/ARCHITECTURE.md`                            |

## File Naming

- **UPPERCASE** for reference documents: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `PLAN.md`, `CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- **snake_case** for scripts generated by Claude or the user
- **No spaces**, no special characters, no accents in file names
- **No status suffixes** in names — status is managed ONLY in `projects/_INDEX.md`
- **Language**: English for file names; content in English or your team's language as needed

## Project Folder Naming

- **kebab-case**: `auth-refactor/`, `api-migration/`, `checkout-fix/`
- No status suffixes: ~~`auth-refactor -IN_DEVELOPMENT-`~~ → `auth-refactor/`

---

## Project Lifecycle

### 1. Create project
- Create folder in `claude-memory/projects/{name}/`
- Create `CURRENT_STATUS.md` (mandatory from the very start)
- Register in `claude-memory/projects/_INDEX.md` with status `PLANNING`

### Small Projects (Lite Mode)
If the project is a fix, a scoped refactor, or a task spanning only a few sessions (plan with fewer than 3 phases):
- Only `CURRENT_STATUS.md` + `CHANGELOG.md` — do not create TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS, PLAN, or TECHNICAL_REPORT
- Analysis and plan go as sections inside CURRENT_STATUS.md
- If the project grows and becomes complex, promote to full structure at that point

### 2. ANALYSIS Phase (status: `PLANNING`)
The first sessions are dedicated to understanding the problem, analyzing the existing code involved, identifying constraints, and defining the approach. These are the sessions that generate the most context and where distillation is most critical.

**Primary output**: `TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md`
- Analysis of the problem or requirement to be solved
- Existing code involved: modules, classes, patterns, dependencies
- Relevant data structures (tables, models, relationships)
- Constraints and limitations discovered
- Design decisions made prior to development (e.g., "approach X, not Y, because...")
- If it's an API integration: endpoints, auth, rate limits, external data model, field-to-field mappings
- **Impact map** (recommended): existing files affected, tables read/written, artifacts/binaries involved. Helps Claude assess the real scope before planning.

**Audience**: Claude in future sessions. Discarded when the project is closed.

### 3. PLANNING Phase (status: `PLANNING`)
With the analysis done, the concrete implementation plan is defined.

**Primary output**: `PLAN.md`
- Ordered phases with description and dependencies
- Files to create or modify per phase, with expected content
- Database changes needed (tables, stored procedures, views, migrations)
- Phase-specific implementation considerations
- Suggested implementation order

**Audience**: Claude in future sessions. Discarded when the project is closed.

### 4. DEVELOPMENT Phase (status: `IN_PROGRESS`)
Iterative implementation phase by phase. Each session produces code and updates memory.

**Primary output**: `TECHNICAL_REPORT.md`
- Technical documentation of the project, enriched as development progresses
- Reflects what was built: files, classes, methods, data structures
- Technical decisions made during implementation and their rationale
- Project-specific lessons learned
- Status of each phase (completed / pending)
- File structure of the developed component
- Optionally, a "Notes for the deployer" section. Relevant data to keep in mind when configuring or deploying the feature.
For example, "External dependencies MUST be configured BEFORE running the data import". These are details to keep in mind when setting up the functionality.

**Audience**: Engineering team. **Survives project closure** as deliverable technical documentation.

### 5. TESTING Phase (status: `TESTING`)
Development completed. Validation, QA, pre-production vs production comparison.

### 6. Complete (status: `RELEASED`)
When the project is released to production:
- `TECHNICAL_REPORT.md` → **kept** as technical documentation (move to `docs/` or a permanent folder)
- `TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md`, `PLAN.md` → can be discarded (their value is already reflected in TECHNICAL_REPORT)
- `CHANGELOG.md` → move to `changelog/` at root if applicable
- Delete the project's folder from `claude-memory/projects/`
- Update `_INDEX.md`: move the line to the "Completed" section
- If the project generated module CLAUDE.md files in `src/`, those **are kept** (they are code context, not project context)

### Project Statuses (in _INDEX.md)

| Status          | Phase                     | Meaning                                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `PLANNING`      | Analysis + Planning       | Problem analysis, plan design                    |
| `IN_PROGRESS`   | Development               | Active implementation phase by phase             |
| `TESTING`       | Testing                   | Development done, QA validation                  |
| `READY`         | Pre-release               | Tested and ready for production                  |
| `RELEASED`      | Completed                 | In production (delete project's folder from projects/) |
| `ON_HOLD`       | Paused                    | Temporarily paused                               |

## Standard Project Documents

| File                   | Mandatory | Created in phase | Audience       | Survives closure |
|------------------------|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| `CURRENT_STATUS.md`    | Yes       | Project creation | Claude         | No               |
| `TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md`  | Yes       | Analysis         | Claude         | No               |

### What Goes Where (practical rule)

**In TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md** — What Claude discovers during investigation:
- Existing code involved, affected modules, dependencies
- Relevant data structures, relationships between tables
- Technical constraints, limitations, edge cases
- Design decisions prior to development
- If it's an API integration: endpoints, auth, rate limits, field-to-field mappings

**In PLAN.md** — What Claude is going to do:
- Ordered phases with files to create/modify
- Dependencies between phases
- Database changes, wiring, configuration

**In TECHNICAL_REPORT.md** — What Claude has built:
- Files created, classes, methods, constants
- Technical decisions made during implementation
- Project-specific lessons learned

**In CURRENT_STATUS.md** — Where we are now:
- What was completed, what remains, concrete next step

**In CHANGELOG.md** — What changed and when:
- Code changes with files and reason

**In LESSONS_LEARNED.md** — What's reusable across projects:
- Only lessons that apply beyond this specific project

## Module CLAUDE.md in src/ (template)

```markdown
# {Module Name}

## What this is
- Description in 2-3 lines of what this module does

## Dependencies
- Framework, libraries, and references used by this module
- E.g.: "React 18, TanStack Query v5, Zod for validation" or "Django 4.2, Celery, PostgreSQL 15"

## Key patterns
- Design patterns and important conventions in the module

## Files
- List of files with a one-line description

## Watch out
- Known pitfalls, common mistakes, things NOT to do
```

Guidelines:
- Maximum ~50 lines. If it needs more, something belongs in a different file.
- Direct, imperative language: "Always validate input before processing", "Never call this method outside the main thread".
- Only information Claude needs to work with the code — no history or changelogs.
- The Dependencies section is especially important in legacy stacks or frameworks with constrained versions: Claude tends to suggest APIs from newer versions that may not be available.

## Session Distillation Protocol

### The Problem
Claude Code's context window runs out. If you don't distill before that happens, the session's work is lost or trapped in conversation transcripts that are noisy and inefficient to reprocess.

### The Principle
> **Each session starts by reading clean .md files and ends by updating them.** Never depend on .docx transcripts as a memory source.

### Distillation Triggers
Claude MUST execute the distillation protocol when:
1. **The user asks for it** — key phrases: "consolidate", "distill", "save progress", "persist the session"
2. **The context is filling up** — Claude must propose it proactively
3. **A significant block of work is completed** — a phase, an important fix, an analysis
4. **Before switching topics** — if transitioning from analysis to coding or vice versa

### What to Update (checklist by phase)

**During ANALYSIS sessions:**
| File | Priority | What to write |
|------|----------|---------------|
| `TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md` | **Primary** | Findings: existing code, data structures, constraints, design decisions |
| `CURRENT_STATUS.md` | **ALWAYS** | "Analysis of X completed, still need to analyze Y" |

**During PLANNING sessions:**
| File | Priority | What to write |
|------|----------|---------------|
| `PLAN.md` | **Primary** | Phases, files to create/modify, order, dependencies |
| `TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md` | If applicable | Enrich if new findings emerged while planning |
| `CURRENT_STATUS.md` | **ALWAYS** | "Plan completed, next step: implement phase 1" |

**During DEVELOPMENT sessions:**
| File | Priority | What to write |
|------|----------|---------------|
| `CURRENT_STATUS.md` | **ALWAYS** | What was done, what's left, concrete next step to resume |
| `TECHNICAL_REPORT.md` | **Primary** | Document what was built: classes, methods, technical decisions |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | If there were changes | Concrete changes with files and reason |
| `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` | If applicable | Only if reusable across projects |
| Module `CLAUDE.md` | **Mandatory if module logic was modified** | Updated patterns, pitfalls, files, dependencies |

### CURRENT_STATUS.md Format When Distilling

```markdown
**Last updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Last session summary**: [1-2 sentences of what was done]
**Next step**: [Concrete action to resume — not "continue development"]
**Done when**: [Verification condition — how to know the next step is completed]

## Done
- ✅ What's completed (cumulative)

## In Progress
- 🔄 What's in progress + exact state

## Next Steps
- [ ] What's pending, ordered by priority

## Blockers
- (if any)
```

The key to `**Next step**` is that it must be **concrete enough that Claude can resume without asking anything**.
The key to `**Done when**` is that it must be **verifiable**: a command, a result, a passing test.

Examples:
- ❌ Next step: "Continue with phase 3" / Done when: "When it's ready"
- ✅ Next step: "Implement UserService.validate(): add email format check + duplicate detection against DB"
- ✅ Done when: "All tests in test_user_service.py pass + manual test: registering duplicate email returns 409"

### Full Workflow Between Sessions

```
Session N
  ├── Claude reads CURRENT_STATUS.md → knows exactly where to resume
  ├── If it needs analysis context → reads TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md
  ├── If it needs the plan → reads PLAN.md
  ├── If it needs code context → reads module CLAUDE.md in src/
  ├── Work together (analysis, code, decisions...)
  ├── ⚠️ Distillation trigger detected
  │     ├── Claude proposes: "I'm going to consolidate the session progress"
  │     └── Claude updates files according to the current phase checklist
  └── End of session — clean context for the next one

Session N+1
  ├── Claude reads CURRENT_STATUS.md (≤50 lines, ~10 sec of context)
  ├── Reads "Next step" → knows the concrete action
  ├── If there's a "Done when" from the previous session → recommended to validate before moving forward
  └── Starts without having loaded any transcripts from previous sessions
```

### Anti-pattern: the .docx transcript
- Do **NOT** save conversations as .docx to "remember"
- Do **NOT** ask Claude to read transcripts from past sessions
- If a transcript already exists and has valuable info → distill to .md files and discard the .docx
- Everything valuable from a conversation **must be distilled** before it ends

### Staleness Rule
If Claude reads a `CURRENT_STATUS.md` whose `Last updated` date is more than 48 hours old, it must ask the user if the information is still valid before assuming it is. Code may have changed outside of Claude (manual hotfixes, merges from other developers, DB changes).

---

## Persistence Rules

1. Distill at the end of every session or significant block of work (mandatory)
2. Reusable technical finding → `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
3. New useful command → `BUILD_COMMANDS.md` or `claude-memory/scripts/`
4. New pattern or pitfall in a module → module `CLAUDE.md` in `src/`
5. **If a session modifies a module's architecture, patterns, or dependencies, updating its local CLAUDE.md is mandatory** — not optional
6. **Never duplicate** — if data already exists in another file, reference it with a relative path
7. New credentials → `CREDENTIALS.md` (remember: this file is in `.gitignore`)
8. Operational debugging guides (timeouts, incorrect counts, cache) → `TESTING_METHODOLOGY.md`

## LESSONS_LEARNED.md Structure

Organize by categories with `##` headers:
```markdown
## Concurrency
- Race condition in shared cache → always use locks or thread-safe collections
- ...

## API / Networking
- ...

## Database
- ...
```

**Pruning rule**: `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` acts as an incubator. When a lesson matures and becomes a standard for a specific module, it should be moved to that module's `CLAUDE.md` ("Watch out" section) and removed from the general file. This keeps LESSONS_LEARNED focused on knowledge pending consolidation.

## Cross-referencing Rule

Before creating something new, Claude must **read the existing equivalent first** as a reference:
- New service → read the `CLAUDE.md` and code of an existing similar service
- New form → read a similar existing form
- New stored procedure → read an equivalent SP following the same pattern
- New module → read the `CLAUDE.md` of a similar module

This applies to any type of project, not just integrations.

## Log Access Rule

Claude must **never** read all files in a logs folder at once. It must read only the specific file it is debugging. Loading multiple logs floods the context unnecessarily.
Unless explicitly instructed otherwise by the user, all logs should be saved in `claude-memory/logs/`.

## Temporary Files

The `claude-memory/temp/` folder is for scratch files, intermediate outputs, and any ephemeral data generated during a session (e.g., exported data, test payloads, diff snapshots). This folder is excluded from version control and can be cleaned at any time.

---

## Version Control (.gitignore)

The following files/folders are NOT versioned:

```
claude-memory/CREDENTIALS.md
claude-memory/logs/
claude-memory/temp/
desktop.ini
.claude/
```

See [`.gitignore-claude-additions`](../.gitignore-claude-additions) for a ready-to-use template.

Everything else in `claude-memory/` IS versioned (ARCHITECTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, projects/, scripts/, etc.)
